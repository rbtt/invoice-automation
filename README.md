# Invoice Automation

## The problem
On the first of every month Boyan has to manually login to [Hubstaff](https://app.hubstaff.com/), check his previous month's working hours then login to his [Invoice Generator Platform](https://****.inv.bg/login) and manually input the hours and convert his hourly rate using the current USD <-> EURO converion rate.

## The solution
Create a minimal NodeJS Microservice which communicates with both APIs and generates the invoice automatically on 1st of every month
